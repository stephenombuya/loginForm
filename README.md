# **Login Page**
This project is a simple login form built with HTML5 and CSS3. It provides a clean and minimal interface for users to log in to their accounts by entering an email address and password. This project can be used as a foundation for more complex login systems involving server-side scripting and database integration.

### **Features**
- **Email and Password Fields**: Users are required to input both an email and password to log in.
- **Responsive Design**: The login form is designed to be responsive and user-friendly on all devices, including mobile and desktop.
- **Form Validation**: Basic client-side validation is applied for email format and password entry.


### **Technologies Used**
- **HTML5**: For structuring the login form and ensuring accessibility.
- **CSS3**: For styling the form, making it visually appealing, and ensuring responsive behavior across devices.

### **Demo**
Live Demo - [Login]()<!-- Add a link to the live version of the project if available -->


### **Project Structure**
- **index.html**: Contains the HTML structure for the login form.
- **styles.css**: Contains the CSS styles to make the login form responsive and visually appealing.

### **How to Use**
1. Clone the repository:

### **Customization**
- **Form Action**: You can modify the action attribute in the form tag to integrate it with server-side scripts for actual login functionality.
- **Styles**: Customize the styles.css file to change the appearance, including fonts, colors, or layout.
